# @macrome/generator-typescript

For `path/to/source.ts` generates `path/to/source.d.ts` and `path/to/source.js` using babel transforms. The `.js` file is produced using `@babel/plugin-transform-typescript`. The `.d.ts` file transformation is implemented as part of this package (for now). This plugin does not do any type checking.

**Not ready for production usage!**
